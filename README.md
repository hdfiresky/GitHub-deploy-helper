A reference implementation demonstrating a secure, automated, zero-downtime deployment strategy for a modern web application built with Vite, React, and TypeScript.

This project serves as both a live demo and a comprehensive guide for setting up a production-grade CI/CD pipeline.

## üöÄ Project Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is not the web application itself, but the robust deployment architecture it showcases. It provides a concrete, step-by-step guide for developers and operations engineers to implement a deployment system that is:

-   **Secure:** Follows the Principle of Least Privilege, isolating the deployment process with a dedicated, non-interactive user.
-   **Automated:** Uses GitHub Actions to build and deploy the application on every push to the `main` branch.
-   **Reliable:** Achieves zero-downtime deployments through an atomic symbolic link switching strategy.
-   **Maintainable:** All past releases are kept on the server, allowing for instant rollbacks at any time.

## ‚ú® Core Concepts Demonstrated

-   **CI/CD with GitHub Actions:** A complete workflow that checks out code, builds the static assets, and securely transfers them to a production server.
-   **Symbolic Link (Symlink) Strategy:** The web server (Nginx) points to a stable symlink (`/var/www/problembuddy/problem-buddy-app`). Each new deployment is placed in a timestamped directory, and the symlink is atomically updated to point to the new version, ensuring users never experience downtime.
-   **Principle of Least Privilege:** A dedicated `deployer` user is created on the server with severely restricted permissions. This user has no interactive shell and can *only* execute a specific deployment script via `sudo`, preventing unauthorized server access.
-   **Atomic Deploys & Instant Rollbacks:** Because the symlink update is a single, atomic operation, the switch to a new release is instantaneous. Rolling back is as simple as manually pointing the symlink back to a previous release directory.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

-   **Frontend:** Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
-   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
-   **Server:** Linux (Ubuntu 22.04), Nginx
-   **Automation:** Bash Scripting, SSH, SCP

## üñ•Ô∏è Local Development

To run this application on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/problem-buddy-app.git
    cd problem-buddy-app
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    npm ci # For a clean install based on package-lock.json
    ```

3.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173/problem-buddy-app/`.

## üåê Deployment

The heart of this project is its deployment process. A complete, production-ready guide is available to set up your own server and CI/CD pipeline from scratch.
